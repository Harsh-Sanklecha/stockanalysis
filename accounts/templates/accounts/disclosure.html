            <li>Futures and options trading have large potential rewards, but also large potential risk.</li>
            <li>You must be aware of the risks and be willing to accept them in order to invest in the futures and options markets.</li>
            <li>Trade with risk capital only. The past performance of any trading strategy or methodology is not necessarily indicative
            of future results.Past performance is no guarantee of future results and should not be interpreted as a forecast of future performance.</li>
            <li>We make no promise as to the performance of the account and while the investment objective is major capital appreciation
            over time no representation is being made or implied that any account will or is likely to achieve profit.</li>
            <li>The value of your investments can decrease as well as increase and, as such, funds invested should constitute risk
            capital.</li>
            <li>The risk of loss in trading commodities and options can be substantial. You should therefore carefully consider whether
            such trading is suitable for you in light of your financial condition.</li>
            <li>The high degree of leverage that is often obtainable in commodity trading can work against you as well as for you. The
            use of leverage can lead to large losses as well as gains. You should carefully consider whether your financial
            condition permits you to participate in futures trading.</li>
            <li>In so doing, you should be aware that futures and options trading can quickly lead to large losses as well as gains.
            Such trading losses can sharply reduce the value of your investment.</li>
